            <div class="text-lg space-y-6">
                <p>If you have ever wanted to code, you will have faced the issue of having to install some packages and
                    applications to make it possible. Python programming is not an exception.</p>
                <p>Python is a high-level programming language which means that Python's <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)"
                        class="text-brand-black dark:text-cream hover:underline">syntax</a> is closer to humans'
                    language than to computer's. That's why learning Python is a good way of entering the world of
                    programming. However, in order to run a Python code on your computer, you need an interpreter.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">What is the Python Interpreter?</h2>
                <p>Python <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"
                        class="text-brand-black dark:text-cream hover:underline">interpreter</a> is the software that
                    reads your code line by line and turns it into machine codes (zeros and ones) and executes each line
                    separately. In this sense, Python is different from a low-level programming language like C++, which
                    uses what we call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"
                        class="text-brand-black dark:text-cream hover:underline">compiler</a>. Compilers, unlike
                    interpreters, don't execute the code line by line. Instead, they turn the whole body of code into a
                    binary file that can be run on the computer.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">Why Use an Online Python Interpreter?</h2>
                <p>Online interpreters are websites that let you write your code in a textbox and then run it on an
                    online server. This way, you don't have to install the interpreter software on your local computer.
                    There are many cases when you want to use a Python interpreter online. You may lack access to your
                    computer and be on someone else's computer temporarily, or you may not want to take the effort to
                    install a Python interpreter in the early stages of learning. Either way, the need for an online
                    Python interpreter may arise at any time.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">Best Online Python Interpreters</h2>
                <p>Let's dive into an introduction to the best free online Python interpreters:</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl pt-4 mb-5 font-medium"><a href="https://www.online-python.com/"
                        class="text-brand-black dark:text-cream hover:underline">Online Python</a></h3>
                <p>Although the website says "beta" which means the project is still incomplete and may fail to work at
                    times, I didn't have any problem using Online Python. However, the very simple user interface is
                    what I liked the most about it. The screenshot below is very telling. Online Python is the ideal
                    online Python interpreter for you if you prefer a straightforward user experience without any ads,
                    pro subscription, or complicated user interface.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl pt-4 mb-5 font-medium"><a href="https://www.programiz.com/"
                        class="text-brand-black dark:text-cream hover:underline">Programiz</a></h3>
                <p>Programiz has a more complicated user interface, but it does get the job done as well as Online
                    Python. From the default code in the file to the buttons, there are many parts of the interface
                    telling you to try the pro subscription, but the user interface is still simpler and more
                    straightforward than the other options.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl pt-4 mb-5 font-medium"><a href="https://www.onlinegdb.com/"
                        class="text-brand-black dark:text-cream hover:underline">OnlineGDB</a></h3>
                <p>OnlineGDB is next on our list of the best online Python interpreters. Although this website offers
                    many more options than Online Python and Programiz, its user interface could be clearer. From ads to
                    the side panel, many things get in the way of concentrating on your code. But once you close and
                    collapse those, there are options like beautifying your code and running it in debug mode. If you
                    are looking for an online interpreter that lets you run your code in debug mode, OnlineGDB is your
                    best option.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl pt-4 mb-5 font-medium"><a href="https://onecompiler.com/python"
                        class="text-brand-black dark:text-cream hover:underline">OneCompiler</a></h3>
                <p>Although OneCompiler has the best user interface of them all, it doesn't offer a console like other
                    options do. Instead, you are given a text box to provide input for your code in advance, which is
                    not the best way of handling things in complex codes.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In this article, we talked about a few different online Python interpreters, and briefly talked about
                    the advantages and disadvantages of each. I hope this has been helpful to you and that you can
                    choose the best option for your work.</p>
