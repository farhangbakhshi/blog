                <p>Have you heard of Linux and need to know what it is? You're reading the right article!</p>
                <p>Whether you have programmer friends or you're new to programming, you are bound to hear
                    about Linux at some point. No matter the reason, if you have heard the name "Linux" or "GNU/Linux" and
                    wondered what it is, you've landed on the right post! I am Farhang, and this is a comprehensive
                    introduction to Linux for those who have yet to learn about it.</p>
                <p>Linux is an operating system, so you must first know what an OS is so you can get to know
                    Linux better. So, in this article, we will first discuss what an OS (Operating System) is and what
                    different types of OS are out there. Next, we will discuss Linux (or GNU/Linux) as the umbrella term
                    that refers to many operating systems and mention some of the most famous instances of Linux operating
                    systems.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">What is an OS?</h2>
                <p>For your computer to run, you need to interact with the computer's hardware. Why do you need
                    to interact with hardware? Because that's where all the computing happens. However, your computer does
                    things only based on a <strong>zero-or-one logic</strong>–as it is known to do. This logic is reliable
                    since the hardware can attribute zero to the absence of electrical pulses and one to their presence.
                    Now, how do we interact with a machine that only understands zeros and ones? Using <strong>computer
                        codes</strong>. Computer codes let you interact with the hardware by <strong>translating your
                        inputs</strong> (whether it be keyboard inputs, clicks, or voice inputs) into zeros and ones. The
                    process of this translation is very complex and requires a separate blog post to explain.</p>
                <p>However, that gets us to the definition of operating systems: <strong>An operating system is
                        a large set of packaged computer codes that let you interact with your computer's hardware
                        efficiently and effectively.</strong> Each package handles a particular set of tasks. Your computer
                    breaks down each of your requirements into smaller tasks and delegates them, each to be handled by a
                    particular package.</p>
                <p>Now, why are there different operating systems? Good question.</p>
                <p>Different requirements that you expect your computer to satisfy–like running a video game or
                    streaming a video–are very <strong>complex tasks</strong>. Each task that you give your computer is like
                    telling it to build a skyscraper. If someone tells you and me to go build two skyscrapers, of course, we
                    might–and probably will–break down the project into smaller steps in our own different ways. In the same
                    way, there are many ways of translating your requirements into zeros and ones on a computer. Hence,
                    <strong>there are different operating systems, each of which has packaged their computer codes in
                        different ways.</strong></p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">Use Cases of Operating Systems</h2>
                <p>Operating systems are not only helping you interact with your computer. Phones and laptops,
                    though the most known devices to use an operating system, are not the only devices using one. The
                    webpage you're on right now has come to you through a series of devices that work in a network to make
                    viewing the page possible. All of those devices, including the main server, use an OS.</p>
                <p>Now, do all electronic devices have an OS? In general, every electronic device with
                    reprogrammable functionality uses an OS. However, there are certain devices that have a fixed
                    functionality and are not reprogrammable. Since <strong>programming is the process of producing software
                        that defines the functionality of hardware</strong>, reprogramming a computer is manipulating or
                    completely changing the software so that you can get new functionality out of the same hardware. Thus,
                    your phone needs an OS since its fixed hardware is supposed to change functionality rapidly (from
                    sending messages to checking Instagram). However, an electronic toaster, for example, cannot and doesn't
                    need to be manipulated on a software level to be a calculator. Hence, your toaster doesn't have an OS.

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">What Are the Most Famous Operating Systems?</h2>
                <p>The most famous operating systems are <strong>Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and
                        iOS.</strong> As you can see, many of these operating systems even have the abbreviation "OS" in
                    their names.</p>
                <p>Where did these all come from? What are Linux "distributions"? Why are there so many? Good
                    questions.</p>
                <p>Let's dive into a short history of how operating systems were developed and why there are so
                    many:</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">Where Did It All Begin?</h2>
                <p>It all began with trying to reprogram electronic devices to serve different goals at
                    different times. Then each group of early operating systems started following their own standards for
                    how they packaged their codes.</p>
                <p>Windows, in the early days, went its own way–and is still doing that. Linux and MacOS,
                    however, are <strong>inspired by the same standard of packaging codes</strong>. This same standard was
                    also used to develop Android and iOS operating systems for phones with touch interfaces during the
                    2000s. The standard, called UNIX, said that each little functionality of programs should be packaged and
                    reusable. This helped develop new software that provided new uses for a computer. The new software could
                    use these smaller functionalities <strong>by delegating some of the process of new
                        functionalities</strong> to these packages–like hiring a contractor for a small part of a big
                    project.</p>
                <p>The UNIX standard was then revised by Richard Stallman to make the GNU standard, using which
                    a lot of software was developed later–mostly by the GNU Foundation.</p>
                <p>Later on, Linus Torvalds made <strong>a kernel</strong> that could effectively connect GNU
                    and other software to the hardware, and called it Linux. Since the kernel was called Linux and a lot of
                    the software was made by the GNU Foundation, the operating system that emerged was originally called
                    <strong>GNU/Linux</strong>. Over time, however, the word Linux has started being attributed to the whole
                    OS, and not only the kernel.</p>
                <p>The GNU Foundation demands that we call this operating system "GNU/Linux" because simply
                    calling it "Linux" would undermine the efforts of those who developed a major part of the OS. However,
                    in favor of choosing descriptive vocabulary over prescriptive language, I call it what almost everybody
                    calls it and get over this subject by acknowledging the work of the selfless people who have developed
                    GNU packages.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">What are Linux Distributions?</h2>
                <p>Linux, unlike Windows and MacOS, is an open-source operating system. Being open-source means
                    that the computer codes written for Linux are available to everybody. As a result of that, any
                    individual or community can take the code, modify it to serve a particular purpose, and re-publish it.
                    Remember, an operating system is a multi-purpose base that you can build upon and make it do whatever
                    you want it to. Since Linux is a minimal OS compared to Windows and MacOS, it is a good ground on which
                    you can build any skyscraper. Since the <strong>basic functionalities of computing and using the
                        hardware resources</strong> are available to you, nothing is impossible on Linux. As long as you
                    know how to code it, there is a way to achieve any functionality that a computer has on Linux.</p>
                <p>So, it is understandable that hackers take the Linux source code and make their own
                    distribution of it. Of course, such a distribution would include computer codes built upon those of
                    GNU/Linux, aimed at paving the way for hackers' codes to run. There are all kinds of distributions for
                    Linux, each made for a certain purpose; from user-friendly distributions aimed at the public to
                    specialized ones for programmers.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">What Are Some Linux Distributions?</h2>
                <p>Linux distributions are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions"
                        class="text-brand-black dark:text-cream hover:underline">very versatile</a>. One result of this versatility is that you
                    can choose whatever you want based on your needs, and another is that you get lost among the distros.
                    Here, we discuss two of the <strong>most famous and user-friendly Linux distributions</strong>. Taking a
                    look at each one's website can help you get more familiar with Linux and better understand what they are
                    made to do.</p>
                <p>Before we dive into it, I should mention that each of these have different versions
                    available, and the information I provide about each is mainly based on the experience I've had with
                    their desktop/workstation versions.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl pt-4 mb-5 font-medium">Ubuntu</h3>
                <p>Ubuntu is the most user-friendly distribution of all. Ubuntu uses a desktop manager system
                    called GNOME, but offers a modified version of it. This modified version of GNOME is not much different
                    from the original one. Ubuntu is offered by Canonical, and one LTS (Long-Term Support) version of it is
                    <strong>released every two years</strong>. Other versions of Ubuntu, released twice a year, are only
                    supported until the next version is released.</p>
                <p>There are also some variants of Ubuntu that use other desktop manager packages like
                    <strong>Kubuntu</strong> (using KDE) and <strong>Xubuntu</strong> (using Xfce). The current LTS version
                    of Ubuntu is the 24.04.1 version, and this article is being written using it.</p>
                <p>Ubuntu is derived from one of the most important distributions of Linux called Debian.
                    Debian is the source for many user-friendly Linux distributions that make it possible for beginners and
                    those who aren't technically skilled to use Linux.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl pt-4 mb-5 font-medium">Fedora</h3>
                <p>Fedora is another one of the user-friendly distributions of Linux. Derived from
                    <strong>RedHat Linux</strong>, Fedora offers a good combination of different packages that are always
                    up-to-date. The <strong>latest version of GNOME</strong>, for example, is always available for use in
                    Fedora Linux.</p>
                <p>Fedora, like Ubuntu, comes in many "flavors" that use different desktop managers.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pt-6 mb-6 font-medium">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In this article, we briefly discussed the different aspects of the Linux operating system.
                    First, a definition of what an OS is, and then a discussion of what type of an operating system Linux
                    is.</p>
                <p>This was the first blog post I wrote for my blog. However, if you want to read more about
